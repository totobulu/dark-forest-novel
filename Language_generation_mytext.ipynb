the fact that there aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any signs .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n*\\n\\nluo ji and shi qiang walked through the underground city shaded by the tree-shaped structures as streams of cars flew through the gaps in the sky above them . because the buildings were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleaves\\xe2\\x80\\x9d hanging in the air , the ground was wide open , and the widely spaced trunks of the giant trees meant there was no sense of streets , just a rolling plaza dotted with tree trunks . the environment was wonderful : the wide swaths of grasses , forests of actual trees , and fresh air all made it look at first glance like beautiful countryside . pedestrians passed through in shining clothes like glowing ants . luo ji was impressed to no end by the urban design that elevated modern noise and crowdedness into the air and let the ground return to nature . here , there was no shadow of the war , only human comforts and pleasures .\\n\\nbefore they had gotten far , he heard a woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gentle voice . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis that mr . luo ji ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he looked around and found that the voice was coming from a billboard on the grass at the side of the road . an attractive woman dressed in a uniform was looking at him from the moving image .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci am ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with a nod .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chello . i am financial counselor 8065 of the general banking system . welcome to our era . i will now inform you of your current financial situation .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as she spoke , a table of data appeared beside her . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthese are your financial records for year 9 of the crisis era , including deposits at the industrial and commercial bank of china and the china construction bank . there are investments in quoted securities as well , but those items may have been partially lost during the great ravine .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chow does she know i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m here ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he whispered .\\n\\nshi qiang said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca chip\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been implanted in your left arm . don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry , these days everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s got one . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like an id card . all billboards can recognize you . ads are all personalized now , so no matter where you go , everything on the billboards is showing just for you .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\napparently hearing shi qiang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words , the counselor said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9csir , this isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t an advertisement . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a service from the general banking system .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chow much do i have on deposit ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji asked .\\n\\na highly complicated chart appeared next to the counselor . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is the status of all your interest-bearing accounts since year 9 of the crisis era . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fairly complicated , but you can access it in your personal information area from now on .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d another , simpler chart popped up . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is your current financial situation in all of the various subsystems of the general banking system .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji had no concept of what those figures meant , and asked blankly , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s . . . how much ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy boy , you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re a rich man !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , slapping him vigorously . \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci may not have as much as you , but i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve still got money . heh , two centuries of interest\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a real long-term investment . pauper to tycoon . i only regret not saving a little more .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwell . . . are you sure there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing wrong ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji asked , skeptically .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chmm ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the big eyes of the counselor looked at luo ji quizzically .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been more than one hundred eighty years . wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t there any inflation ? did the finance system really just continue on smoothly ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re overthinking it ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , taking a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket . luo ji knew then that tobacco was still around . but when shi qiang took one out , he was able to puff out clouds of smoke without lighting it .\\n\\nthe counselor replied , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere were many rounds of inflation during the great ravine , and the finance and credit systems came close to collapse . but according to current laws , interest on the deposits of hibernators is calculated according to a special formula that excludes the great ravine , and instead transfers the deposit amount over to the financial level of the post-ravine period and resumes calculating interest from there .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwow , that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some preferential treatment !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji exclaimed .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy boy , these are good times ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , blowing out smoke . then , raising his still-burning cigarette , he said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexcept the cigarettes are terrible .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmr . luo ji , this is just an opportunity for us to get acquainted . when it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s convenient for you , we can discuss your personal financial arrangements and investment plan . if there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing else , then i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll say good-bye .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the counselor smiled and waved good-bye .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got one question ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said quickly . he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know what to call young women in this era , and didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to risk making a mistake by addressing her improperly . so he simply said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not too familiar with this era , so please forgive me if my question is offensive to you .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe counselor smiled , and said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot a problem . our responsibility is to help you get acquainted with this era as quickly as possible .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9care you a real person or a robot ? or are you a program ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe question didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t faze the counselor . she replied , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof course i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a real person . could a computer handle services as complicated as this ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nafter the woman on the billboard disappeared , luo ji said to shi qiang , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cda shi , there are some things i find hard to understand . this is an age that has invented perpetual motion and can synthesize grain , but computer technology doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to have advanced at all . artificial intelligence can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even handle personal finance .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat perpetual motion ? you mean a perpetual motion machine ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyeah . it signifies unlimited energy .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang looked around him . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhere ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji pointed up to the stream of traffic . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthose flying cars . do they consume oil or batteries ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang shook his head . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneither . earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil was pumped dry . those cars can fly forever without batteries and they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never run out of power . they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re pretty awesome . i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m thinking of getting one myself .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chow can you be so unmoved by a technological miracle ? unlimited power for humanity . this is as big an event as when pangu created the heavens and the earth ! don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t you realize what a magnificent age this is ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang tossed aside the cigarette butt ; then , thinking better of it , reached down and retrieved it from the grass and threw it into a nearby garbage can . \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99m unmoved ? you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re an intellectual whose imagination has gotten away from him . the technology is something we actually had in our era .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to be kidding .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand most tech , but i do know a bit about this one thing in particular because , as it happens , i once had occasion to use a police bug that had no batteries but never ran out of power . you know how it worked ? it was powered remotely by microwaves . that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s what electricity is today , although the methods are a little different from our day .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji stopped and stared at shi qiang for a long while , then up at the flying cars in the air . he thought about the heating glass , and finally understood : it was just a wireless power supply . the power source emitted electricity in the form of microwaves or other em radiation to form an electric field over a certain space , allowing any equipment within it to draw power through an antenna or resonant coil . like shi qiang had said , even two centuries ago , this technology was entirely ordinary . the only reason it hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t been commonplace was because the power loss was too great . only a small portion of the power emitted into a space could be used , but the majority was lost . in this era , however , mature controlled fusion technology meant that energy sources had been greatly enriched , to the point that losses from wireless power supplies were acceptable .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand the synthetic grain ? can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t they synthesize grain ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji asked .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not really sure about that . grain is still grown from seed , it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just that it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grown in factories in those cultivation tank things . crops are all genetically modified , and i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve heard that wheat grows just an ear , with no stalk . and it grows pretty quickly because of the strong artificial sunlight , and other things like intense , growth-inducing radiation . a season of wheat and rice can be harvested in a week , so from the outside it looks just like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s produced on a production line .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9coh\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji punctuated his thought with an extended sigh as the gorgeous bubbles before his eyes burst to reveal the true face of the world , and he knew that in this great new era , sophons still floated everywhere and human science was still deadlocked . existing technology could never cross the line set down by the sophons .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand the spacecraft that can reach fifteen percent of light speed ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwell , that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true . when those warships mobilize , it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s like a tiny sun in the sky . and their space weapons\\xe2\\x80\\x94the day before yesterday i saw a news report on tv about an asian fleet exercise . a laser cannon swept a target ship as big as a carrier . half of that iron guy evaporated like a chunk of ice , and the other half exploded like fireworks in a shower of sparkling molten steel . and there are railguns that can fire a hundred iron spheres a second , each the size of a football , at tens of kilometers per second . in a few minutes they can flatten a mountain on mars . . . . so even though there isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any of your perpetual motion , with these technologies , humanity is more than capable of putting down the trisolaran fleet .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang handed luo ji a cigarette and taught him how to twist the filter tip to light it . they smoked and watched the snow-white swirls drift upward . \\xe2\\x80\\x9canyway , my boy , these are good times .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes . good times .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji had hardly finished speaking when shi qiang pounced on him and the two of them tumbled onto the grass a few meters away , hearing a loud noise at their heels as a flying car smashed into the spot where they had just been standing . luo ji felt the impact of the blast , and metal debris whizzed overhead , taking out half the billboard and sending the transparent glass tubes of the display crashing to the ground . while he was still on the ground with a dizzy head and a black eye , shi qiang leapt up and ran over to the flying car . its disc-shaped body was entirely broken and deformed , but due to the lack of onboard fuel , it hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t caught fire . there was only the sound of sparks crackling in the twisted metal .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no one in the car ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said to luo ji , who was limping over .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cda shi , you saved my life again ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji said , leaning on his shoulder and massaging his injured leg .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how many times i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to . you really ought to grow some sense , and a few more eyes .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed to the totaled flying car . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremind you of anything ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji thought about that occasion two centuries before and shivered involuntarily .\\n\\nlots of pedestrians crowded round , the scenes of terror on their clothing flashing as one . two police cars landed , sirens blaring , and several officers got out to form a line around the broken car . their uniforms flashed like the police light , drowning out the crowd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clothing with their brightness . the one officer who came over to shi qiang and luo ji had clothing so bright they had to shut their eyes .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou were right here when the car fell . you aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hurt , are you ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said with concern . he evidently could see that the two of them were hibernators , because he made an effort to speak \\xe2\\x80\\x9cancient chinese .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbefore luo ji could answer , shi qiang pulled the officer who had asked the question across the tape and out of the crowd . once they had gotten away , the officer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uniform stopped flashing .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou need to check up on this . it might be an assassination attempt ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said .\\n\\nthe officer laughed . \\xe2\\x80\\x9creally ? it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a traffic accident .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe want to report it .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9care you sure ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cof course . we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re reporting it .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou\\xe2\\x80\\x99re making a big deal out of it . you may have been startled , but it really was a traffic accident . however , according to the law , if you insist on reporting it . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe insist .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe officer pressed a display area on his sleeve . it popped up an information window , which he looked over , and then said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been reported . for the next forty-eight hours , the police will track you , but this requires your agreement .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe agree . we might still be in danger .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe officer laughed again . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really a common occurrence .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ca common occurrence ? let me ask you : on average , how many traffic accidents of this kind take place in this city every month ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere were six or seven all of last year !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have you know , officer : in our time , this city had more than that every day .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccars all ran on the ground in your day . i can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even imagine how dangerous that was . well , you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re now in the police surveillance system . you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be notified of any progress on your case , but , please believe me , this is an ordinary traffic accident . whether or not you filed a report , you would still receive compensation .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nafter they left the police and the scene of the accident behind , shi qiang said to luo ji , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99d better get back to my place . i don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t feel at ease when i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m outside . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not far . we probably should walk back . taxis are unmanned , so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not safe .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the eto been destroyed ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji asked , looking about him . off in the distance , the fallen car had been lifted up by a larger flying car . the crowd had dispersed , and the police car had left . a municipal works vehicle had landed , and several workmen had gotten out to gather scattered debris and begin repairs to the ground , which had been damaged by the crash . following the small commotion , the city had returned to its normal , pleasing calm .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cperhaps it has . but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to trust my intuition , my boy .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99m no longer a wallfacer .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat car didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seem to think so . . . . while we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re walking , pay attention to the cars above you .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthey kept to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshade\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the treelike buildings as much as possible , and crossed any open spaces they reached at a run . soon they arrived at a broad plaza , and shi qiang said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy place is just opposite . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too far to go around , so we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll have to make a run for it .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cisn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t that being a little paranoid ? maybe it was just a traffic accident .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a \\xe2\\x80\\x98maybe ,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 though . there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nothing wrong with being careful . . . . see that sculpture in the center of the plaza ? if anything happens , we can hide there .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthere was a square sandy area in the center of the plaza , like a miniature desert . the sculpture that shi qiang mentioned , located right in the center of the sand , was a group of black pillar-like objects , each two or three meters tall . from a distance , it looked like a grove of withered black trees .\\n\\nluo ji ran across the plaza behind shi qiang . when they neared the sandy area , he heard shi qiang call , \\xe2\\x80\\x9churry . get in there !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and he was dragged skidding across the sand and then headlong into the withered grove . lying on the grove\\xe2\\x80\\x99s warm sand , he looked up between the black pillars at the sky and saw a flying car zoom down and buzz the grove before pulling up and accelerating away . the gust of wind it left in its wake blew a burst of sand into the air , which hit the pillars with a whoosh .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmaybe it wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t headed for us .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chmm . maybe ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , as he sat up and dumped the sand out of his shoes .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill they laugh at us for this ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be afraid of that crap . who\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to recognize you ? besides , we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re from two centuries ago , so even if we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re entirely normal , people are still gonna laugh . my boy , nothing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lost by being careful . what if the thing really was headed for you ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nonly then did luo ji turn his attention to the sculpture they were inside . he noticed that the pillars weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t withered trees , but arms extending out of the desert . the skinny arms were just skin and bones , so at first glance they looked like dead tree trunks . the hands atop them made a variety of distorted gestures to the sky and seemed to express a kind of endless pain .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat kind of sculpture is this ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d within this group of struggling arms , luo ji felt a chill , even though he was still sweating from the run . at the sculpture\\xe2\\x80\\x99s edge , he saw a solemn obelisk , on which was carved a line of large golden characters : make time for civilization , for civilization won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t make time .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe great ravine memorial ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said . he did not seem interested in explaining further , but led luo ji out of the sculpture and across the other half of the plaza at a fast clip . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cokay , my boy . this tree\\xe2\\x80\\x99s where i live ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , pointing to the massive architectural tree in front of them .\\n\\nluo ji looked around him as he walked . all of a sudden he heard the floor creak , and then the ground fell away under his feet and he plummeted downward . shi qiang grabbed hold of him when his chest was already at ground level and struggled to haul him up . after he had his footing , the two of them stared at the hole in the ground . it was the mouth of a sewer , and its cover had slid aside just as luo ji was about to step on it .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy god ! are you all right , sir ? that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really dangerous !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d said a voice issuing from a small billboard next to them . the billboard was attached to a small pavilion containing a machine selling drinks and such , and the speaker was a young man dressed in a blue uniform . his face was pale , and he seemed even more frightened than luo ji . \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99m with the office of evacuation and drainage at the third municipal administration company . that cover opened automatically . it might be a software failure .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes this happen often ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang asked .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9coh , no , no . at least , this is the first time i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve ever seen it .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang picked up a small round stone from the grass next to the road and tossed it down the hole . it was quite some time before they heard any sound . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdamn . how deep is it ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked the man in the billboard .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9caround thirty meters . so , like i said , it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s really dangerous ! i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve inspected the surface drainage system . the sewers in your day were all pretty shallow . this accident has been recorded . you . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he glanced at his sleeve as he spoke . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cah , mr . luo . you can go to the tmac to be compensated .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nat last they reached the lobby leading to shi qiang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tree , #1863 . he said that he lived on branch 106 , near the top , and advised luo ji to eat down below before going up . they went into a restaurant on one side of the lobby . aside from being as clean as a 3d rendering , one characteristic of this age was even more obvious here than when he first saw it in the reawakening center : dynamic information windows were everywhere , on the walls , tabletops , chairs , the floor and ceiling , and even on small objects like the glasses and napkin holders on the table . everything had an interface and display with scrolling text or moving images . it was as if the entire restaurant was a giant computer display showing off a diverse and glittering splendor .\\n\\nnot many people were dining . they chose a table by the window and sat down . shi qiang tapped the tabletop to activate an interface and then ordered a few dishes . \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t read the foreign writing , so i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve only ordered chinese ones .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe world seems like it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s built using bricks made from displays ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji sighed .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right . anything smooth can light up .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as shi qiang spoke he took out a pack of cigarettes and passed it to luo ji . \\xe2\\x80\\x9clook at this . just a pack of cheap cigarettes .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as soon as luo ji held the pack in his hands , it started displaying an animated image of several miniature pictures that seemed like an options menu .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis . . . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just a film that can display images ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji said as he looked at the pack .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ca film ? you can go online with this gadget !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang reached over and tapped the pack , and one of the miniature pictures sank in like a button . then the advertisement he selected took over the entire pack .\\n\\nin the picture , luo ji saw a family with one child sitting in a living room . the picture obviously came from the past , and a shrill voice sounded from the pack : \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmr . luo , this is the era you used to live in . we know that in that age , owning a house in the capital was the grand dream of every person . now , the greenleaf group can help you achieve that dream . as you can see , this is a wonderful age . houses have turned into leaves on a tree , and the greenleaf group can provide you with every kind of leaf .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here the picture showed a scene of leaves being added to a tree branch , and then a dazzling variety of hanging homes , one of which was even completely transparent , with furnishings inside that seemed suspended in midair . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cof course , we can also build you a traditional home on the surface to return you to the warmth of the golden age , and build you a warm . . . family . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a lawn and detached home , perhaps another old photo , appeared onscreen . the voice artist in the ad spoke in fluent \\xe2\\x80\\x9cancient chinese ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but paused momentarily before the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamily ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then said it with particular emphasis . after all , it was something the speaker didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have , something that belonged to the past .\\n\\nshi qiang took the cigarette pack out of luo ji\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands , withdrew the last two cigarettes , passed one to him , and then crumpled the empty pack into a ball and tossed it onto the table . on the crumpled ball , the images still flashed , but the sound had disappeared . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhenever i go anywhere , the first thing i do is to turn off every screen that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s around me . they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re so annoying ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , turning off the tabletop and floor displays with his hands and feet . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut the people here can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be away from them .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he pointed around them . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t any computers anymore . anyone who wants to go online or something can just tap any smooth surface . clothing and shoes can be used as computers , too . believe it or not , i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve even seen toilet paper that you can go online with .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji pulled out a napkin . it was just ordinary , non-wired paper , but the paper box activated , and the pretty woman on it hawked bandages to luo ji , evidently aware of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experiences and guessing that his arms and legs might have gotten scraped up .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cgod ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji sighed , and stuffed the napkin back in the box .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is the information age . our times were pretty damn primitive ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said with a laugh .\\n\\nwhile they waited for their food , luo ji asked shi qiang about his life . he felt a little guilty for only asking now , but looking back on how the day had gone , he had been something of a clockwork machine ticking relentlessly forward . only now did he have a bit of free time .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey had me retire . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not a bad deal ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said simply .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas it the public security bureau , or the unit you were at later ? are they still around ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re around . and the psb is still the psb . but even before hibernation i wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t connected to it anymore . the unit i was with later now belongs to the asian fleet . you know , the fleet is like a big country , so i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m a foreigner now .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d saying this , he exhaled a long cloud of smoke . he watched the cloud ascend , as if he was trying hard to unravel a mystery .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccountries don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the significance they used to . . . . the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s changed . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confusing . fortunately , da shi , you and i are the kind of indifferent people who can live , and live well , no matter what happens .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cluo , my boy , to tell you the truth , i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not as open-minded as you in certain things . i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not as uninvolved . if i\\xe2\\x80\\x99d been through everything you have , i\\xe2\\x80\\x99d have fallen apart long ago .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji picked up the crumpled cigarette pack from the table , opening it to reveal the image that was still showing , with only a little discoloration . it was playing the greenleaf group advert . he said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether as messiah , or as refugee , i can always use what resources i have to try and live a happy life . you might think i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m selfish , but to be honest , this is the only thing i respect about myself . da shi , let me say something about you . you look like a careless person , but deep in your bones you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re someone who prizes responsibility . leave that responsibility completely behind now . look at this age . who needs us ? carpe diem is our most sacred duty .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csure , but if i gave up all responsibility , you wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have much of an appetite at all right now .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang tossed his cigarette into the ashtray , activating a cigarette advert .\\n\\nluo ji realized he had misspoken . \\xe2\\x80\\x9coh , no , da shi , you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve still got to carry out your responsibility to me . i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll die if i leave you . already today you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve saved me one , two , three times . or at least two and a half !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just leave someone to die , you mean ? that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the life i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got , a life of saving yours ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said disapprovingly as he cast his eyes about him , probably looking for someplace selling cigarettes . then he looked back , leaned in to luo ji , and whispered , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you really were a messiah for a little while , my boy .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible for anyone in that position to be of sound mind . fortunately , i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m now back to normal .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chow did you come up with the idea of putting a spell on that star ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci was seriously paranoid back then . i don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to think about it . believe it or not , da shi , i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m certain that while i was asleep , they not only cured my illness , but also conducted psychiatric treatment . really , i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not the same person now that i was back then . how could i have been so stupid as to have that kind of idea ? that sort of delusion ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat delusion ? let me hear it .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s difficult to explain briefly . besides , there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s no point . in your work , you must have run into delusional patients , people who were always thinking someone wanted to kill them . is there any point to listening to those people talk ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji methodically tore the cigarette pack into pieces . this time the display was destroyed , but the scraps still flashed in a grotesquely colored heap .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cokay . we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll talk about something happy . my son is still alive .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji asked , practically jumping up in his surprise .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci just learned about it two days ago . he looked me up . we haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t met , just spoken by phone .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9che\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how long he spent in prison , but afterward he went into hibernation . he said it was to come to the future to see me . who knows where the kid got the money . now he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the surface , and he\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arranged to come over tomorrow .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji stood up excitedly , sweeping flashing scraps of paper to the floor . \\xe2\\x80\\x9coh , da shi , that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just . . . we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got to drink to that .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ca drink , then . the alcohol in this age tastes awful , but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still the same strength .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthen the food came . luo ji didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize anything , and shi qiang said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing\\xe2\\x80\\x99s good . there are restaurants supplied by traditional farms , but those are all high-end places . we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll eat at one when xiaoming comes .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nbut luo ji\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention had shifted to the server . her face and body were unrealistically beautiful , and he saw that the other servers sliding between the tables had the same angelic appearance .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chey , don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stare like an idiot . they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re fake ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , without looking up .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9crobots ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji asked . at last the future had something he had seen in one of his childhood science fiction stories .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csort of .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat do you mean , \\xe2\\x80\\x98sort of\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang pointed to a robot server and said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis silly girl only knows how to serve food . they travel fixed paths . how stupid is that ? once i saw a table that had been temporarily moved , but they kept bringing dishes to the original location , so everything crashed to the ground .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nwhen the robot server had laid out the food , it smiled sweetly and wished them a good meal . its voice did not sound robotic , but was incredibly lovely . then , it extended a slender hand and picked up the dinner knife in front of shi qiang . . . .\\n\\nlike lightning , shi qiang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes shot from the knife in the server\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands to luo ji across the table from him . he leapt up , vaulted the table , and pulled luo ji violently off his chair to the floor . almost simultaneously , the robot stabbed the knife right where luo ji\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart would have been . the knife went through the back of the chair , activating its information interface . the robot retracted the knife and stood beside the table with a serving tray in its other hand , still with the sweet smile on its unrealistically beautiful face . panicked , luo ji struggled to stand up , then hid behind shi qiang . but shi qiang just waved his hand , saying , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdon\\xe2\\x80\\x99t worry . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that agile .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe robot stood motionless , holding the knife and smiling , and once again wished them a good meal in its gentle voice .\\n\\nthe startled diners had clustered around them looking at the scene in amazement . then the duty manager came rushing over . when she heard shi qiang accusing the restaurant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s robot of attempted murder , she shook her head . \\xe2\\x80\\x9csir , that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impossible ! their eyes don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t see people . they only see the sensors on the tables and chairs !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll testify that it picked up a dinner knife and tried to kill that man . we saw it with our own eyes !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one man said in a loud voice . the other onlookers added their proof .\\n\\nwhile the duty manager was considering how to rebut this , the robot stabbed the knife at the chair a second time , putting it precisely through the hole punctured the first time and eliciting a few screams .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chave a pleasant meal ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it said with a smile .\\n\\na number of other people arrived , including the restaurant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s engineer . when he pressed the back of the robot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s head , the smile left her face and she said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cforced shutdown . breakpoint data backed up .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then she froze in place .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probably a software failure ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the engineer said , wiping away cold sweat .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes this happen often ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said with a sarcastic smile .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cno , no . i swear , i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve never even heard of anything like this ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the engineer said , then directed two assistants to haul the robot out .\\n\\nthe duty manager energetically explained to the customers that until the cause of the failure was identified , the restaurant would use real human servers , but about half of the customers left anyway .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou both reacted pretty fast ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one bystander said admiringly .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chibernators . in their era , people had experience with this kind of sudden incident ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d someone else said . his clothing displayed a swordsman .\\n\\nthe duty manager said to luo ji and shi qiang , \\xe2\\x80\\x9csirs , this was truly . . . anyway , i guarantee that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll receive compensation .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood . now let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eat .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang beckoned luo ji to retake his seat , and a human server brought over new dishes to replace those that had spilled .\\n\\nsitting there , his shock not yet abated , luo ji felt the uncomfortable hole in the chair back . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cda shi , it seems the whole world is against me . i used to have a favorable impression of it .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang considered one of the dishes in front of him , then said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got some ideas about this .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he looked up and poured luo ji a drink . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cignore it for now . i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll tell you in detail later .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chere : to carpe diem , to living one day at a time . one hour at a time , even ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji said as he raised his glass . \\xe2\\x80\\x9chere\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to your still-living son .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9care you really okay ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , shooting him a smile .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been a messiah . nothing scares me .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he shrugged , then drained his glass . the taste of the alcohol made him wince . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is like rocket fuel .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou kill me , my boy . that attitude of yours has always killed me ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , sticking up a thumb .\\n\\nthe leaf where shi qiang lived was at the top of the tree . it was a spacious house , and was fully equipped with facilities for comfortable living . it had a gym , and even an indoor garden with a fountain .\\n\\nhe said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe fleet gave me these temporary living quarters . they said i can buy a better leaf with my retirement money .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes everyone have so much space to live in these days ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cprobably . this kind of structure is the best use of space . a big leaf is equivalent to an entire building from our era . but mainly it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s because there are fewer people . far fewer , ever since the great ravine .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut da shi , your country is in space .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be going there . i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m already retired , you know .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji\\xe2\\x80\\x99s eyes felt more comfortable here , largely because most of the information windows in shi qiang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s house were closed , although there were scattered flashes in the walls and on the floor . shi qiang tapped an interface on the floor with his foot , turning one wall entirely transparent and unfurling the night city before their eyes . it was a dazzling , giant forest of christmas trees chained together by the lights of the traffic .\\n\\nluo ji went over to the sofa , which was hard as marble to the touch . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis this for sitting ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked . at shi qiang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affirmative , he sat gingerly down on it , only to feel like he was sinking into soft clay . the sofa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cushions and backrest adapted to a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body , forming a mold completely in sync with their body shape , keeping pressure to a minimum .\\n\\nhis vision from the slab of iron ore in the meditation room of the un building two centuries ago had become reality .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo you have any sleeping pills ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he asked . now that he was in a space that felt safe , exhaustion hit him .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cno , but you can buy them here ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , and operated the wall again . \\xe2\\x80\\x9chere . nonprescription sleeping pills . this one , river of dreams .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nalthough luo ji thought he would witness some sort of high-tech hardware-over-the-network transmission , the reality was much simpler than he imagined . in a few minutes , a small , flying delivery van pulled up outside the transparent wall and delivered the medicine through the portal that had just opened up with a slender mechanical arm . luo ji took the medicine from shi qiang . it was a traditional box without any active display . the instructions said to take one pill , so he opened the pack , took one out , and reached out for the glass of water on the coffee table .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwait a moment ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , taking the box out of luo ji\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hands and reading it carefully before returning it to him . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat does this say ? the one i asked for was called river of dreams .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nluo ji saw a long string of complicated english-language drug names . \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t recognize it . but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certainly not river of dreams .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang activated a window on the coffee table and began looking for a medical consult . with luo ji\\xe2\\x80\\x99s help , they found one , a white-clothed consulting physician who examined the box , then looked from the box to shi qiang with a peculiar expression .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhere did this come from ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the doctor asked warily .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci bought it . right here .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cimpossible . this is a prescription drug . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only for use in the hibernation center .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s it got to do with hibernation ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s short-term hibernation medicine . it can make someone hibernate for ten days to a year .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou just swallow it ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cno . it requires a whole set of external systems to sustain internal bodily circulatory functions before short-term hibernation can be achieved .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand if you take it without them ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d die for sure . but you\\xe2\\x80\\x99d die comfortably . so it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s often used for suicide .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang closed the window and tossed the box onto the table . he looked straight at luo ji for a while , then said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdamn it .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdamn it ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji said , pitching back onto the sofa . then he was subjected to the final attempt on his life that day .\\n\\nwhen his head touched back against the sofa , the hard headrest quickly adapted to the back of his head and began to form an impression of its shape . but the process didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t stop there . his head and neck continued to sink , until the headrest on either side formed a pair of tentacles that squeezed tight around his neck . he had no time to cry out , but could only open his mouth and eyes and scramble with his hands .\\n\\nshi qiang bounded into the kitchen and returned with a knife , which he used to hack at the tentacles a few times , then resorted to his own hands to pry them from luo ji\\xe2\\x80\\x99s neck . when luo ji left the sofa and pitched forward onto the floor , the sofa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surface lit up and displayed a large string of error messages .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chow many times have i saved your life today , my boy ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang asked , rubbing his hands .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis is . . . the . . . sixth ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji said , through gasps . he vomited onto the floor . when he finished , he leaned back weakly against the sofa , but then pulled back immediately , as if shocked . he didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know where to put his hands . \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow long will it be before i can be as agile as you and save my own life ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cprobably never ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said . a vacuum cleaner\\xe2\\x80\\x93like machine glided over to clean up the vomit on the floor .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen i\\xe2\\x80\\x99m dead meat . this is a twisted world .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not that bad . i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got an idea about the whole situation , at least . the first attempt on your life failed , and then there were five more attempts . this is stupidity , not professional behavior . something somewhere must have gone wrong . . . . let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contact the police immediately . we can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wait for them to crack the case .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho made a mistake , and where ? da shi , it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s been two centuries . don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t just apply your mind-set from our time .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the same thing , my boy . certain things are the same no matter the age . as for whose mistake it is , i really don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know . i even wonder whether such a \\xe2\\x80\\x98who\\xe2\\x80\\x99 actually exists . . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe doorbell rang . shi qiang opened it to see several people standing outside . they wore civilian clothes , but shi qiang identified them before the leader had even flashed his id .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwow . so there are actual footbeats in this society . come on in , officers .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthree of them entered the house , leaving two others outside to guard the door . the officer in charge , who looked about thirty years old , surveyed the room . like shi qiang and luo ji , he had all the displays on his clothes turned off , which put them at ease , and he spoke a pure , fluent \\xe2\\x80\\x9cancient chinese\\xe2\\x80\\x9d without any english words .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99m officer guo zhengming with the psb\\xe2\\x80\\x99s digital reality department . i apologize for our tardy arrival . that was negligent . the last time there was a case like this was half a century ago .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he bowed to shi qiang . \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci pay my respects to my senior officer . aptitude like yours is very rare in the force these days .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nas officer guo was speaking , luo ji and shi qiang noticed that all of the information windows in the house had switched off . the leaf had evidently been cut off from the external hyper-information world . the other two officers were hard at work . they were holding something he hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t seen in ages : a notebook computer . but the computer was as thin as a sheet of paper .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey\\xe2\\x80\\x99re installing a firewall for this leaf ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d officer guo explained . \\xe2\\x80\\x9crest assured , you\\xe2\\x80\\x99re safe now . and i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll guarantee that you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll receive compensation from the municipal psb system .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctoday ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , counting off on his fingers , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been guaranteed compensation four times .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci know . and lots of people in lots of departments have lost their jobs over this . i beg for your cooperation , so that i don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t join them . thanks in advance ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he said , bowing to them .\\n\\nshi qiang said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci understand that . i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been in that position . do you need us to brief you on the situation ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cno . we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve actually been tracking you all along . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just negligence .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccan you tell us what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s happening ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ckiller 5 .2 .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a network virus . the eto first released it about a century into the crisis era , and then there were lots of subsequent variants and upgrades . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a murder virus . first it establishes the identity of the target by a variety of methods including the chip everyone has implanted in their body . when it locates the target , the killer virus manipulates every possible piece of external hardware to carry out the murder . its concrete manifestation is what you experienced today . it seems like everything in the world wants to kill you . so , at the time , people called it a \\xe2\\x80\\x98modern hex .\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for a while , the killer software was even commercialized and sold on the online black market . you entered the personal id number of your target and uploaded the virus . then , even if that person was able to evade death , they would still have a hard time living in society .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe industry developed as far as that ? incredible !\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang exclaimed .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csoftware from a century ago can still run today ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji asked incredulously .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csure it can . computer technology stopped advancing long ago . when the killer virus first appeared , it killed quite a few people , including a head of state , but eventually it was controlled by firewalls and antivirus software and gradually faded away . this version of killer is programed specifically to attack dr . luo , but because the target was in hibernation , it never had the opportunity to take any concrete action . it stayed dormant and wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t detected or recorded by the information security system . it was only when dr . luo emerged into the world today that killer 5 .2 activated itself and carried out its mission . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s just that its creators were wiped out a century ago .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey were still trying to kill me a century ago ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji said . a mood he thought was gone forever returned , and he struggled to dispel it again .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes . the key thing about this version of the killer virus is that it was programmed specifically for you . it was never activated , which is why it was still lurking in wait today .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen what are we supposed to do now ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang asked .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe entire system will be cleaned of killer 5 .2 , but that will take some time . before it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s completed , you have two choices . first , dr . luo can be given a temporary false identity , but this will not totally guarantee his safety and might lead to other more serious consequences . due to the technological sophistication of the eto software , killer 5 .2 might have already recorded other characteristics of its target . in one case that caused a sensation a century ago , when a protected individual was given a false identity , killer used fuzzy recognition to simultaneously kill over a hundred people , target included . the other choice , and my personal recommendation , is for you to live up on the surface for a while . killer 5 .2 won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any hardware to manipulate up there .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nshi qiang said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9ci agree . even without this situation , i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been wanting to go up to the surface .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on the surface ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji asked .\\n\\nshi qiang explained , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmost of the reawakened hibernators live on the surface . it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard for them to adapt down here .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right . so you ought to spend at least some time up there ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d officer guo said . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmany aspects of modern society\\xe2\\x80\\x94politics , economics , culture , lifestyle , and relations between the sexes\\xe2\\x80\\x94have changed greatly in two centuries , so it takes some time for us to adapt .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve adapted well enough ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d shi qiang said , looking him over . he and luo ji had both noticed that the officer had said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cus .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci went into hibernation because of leukemia , and i was quite young when i reawakened , just thirteen years old ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d guo zhengming said with a laugh . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut people still don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t understand the difficulties i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve had . i don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know how many times i\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve gone for psychological treatment .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9care there many other hibernators like you who have totally adapted to modern life ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d luo ji asked .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9clots . but you can still live quite well on the surface .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n*\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial contingent of future reinforcements commander zhang beihai reporting ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d zhang beihai said , and saluted .\\n\\nbehind the commander of the asian fleet flowed the brilliant milky way . fleet command was in orbit around jupiter and rotated continuously to produce artificial gravity . zhang beihai noticed that the room lights were relatively dim , and the wide windows seemed intended to integrate the interior environment with space outside as closely as possible .\\n\\nthe commander saluted back . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreetings , predecessor .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d he looked quite young , his asian features illuminated by the glow of his epaulets and cap insignia . when he was issued a uniform on the sixth day after he reawakened , zhang beihai had noticed the familiar emblem of the space force : a silver star shining rays in four directions , the rays in the shape of sword . two centuries had passed , and while the insignia had not changed much , the fleet had become an independent country , with a president as its supreme leader . the commander was just in charge of the military .\\n\\nzhang beihai said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s too much , commander . we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re all just new recruits now , who have to learn everything .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe commander smiled and shook his head . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyou can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t say that . you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve already learned everything there is to know here . and the knowledge you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got , we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll never be able to learn . that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s why we awakened you now .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommander chang weisi of the chinese space force asked me to convey his greetings .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nzhang beihai\\xe2\\x80\\x99s words touched something in the commander\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart . he turned and looked out through the window at the river of stars , like the upper reaches of a long river . \\xe2\\x80\\x9che was an exceptional general , one of the founders of the asian fleet . today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s space strategy still uses the framework he established two centuries ago . i wish that he could have seen this day .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctoday\\xe2\\x80\\x99s achievements are far beyond anything he ever dreamed .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut all of this began in his . . . in your time .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthen jupiter appeared , at first as a sliver of an arc that quickly took over the entire field of view in the window , bathing the office in its orange light . the dreamlike patterns of hydrogen and helium in its vast gaseous ocean were on a breathtaking scale and fascinating in their detail . the great red spot moved into view . the superstorm that could hold two earths looked like the giant , pupilless eye of this blurry world . the three fleets had put their primary base on jupiter because its hydrogen-helium ocean held an inexhaustible supply of fusion fuel .\\n\\nzhang beihai was transfixed by the jovian scene . countless times he had dreamed of the new domain that now presented itself before his eyes . he waited until jupiter had moved out of the window before speaking . \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommander , the great achievements of this age are what make our mission unnecessary .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe commander turned to him and said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno , that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not right . the future reinforcement plan was a farsighted initiative . during the great ravine , when the space armed forces were on the brink of collapse , the special reinforcement contingents played a major role in stabilizing the overall situation .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut our contingent arrived too late to be of assistance .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci\\xe2\\x80\\x99m sorry , but that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s how things are ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the commander said . the lines on his face turned gentle . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cafter you left , they sent more special reinforcement contingents to the future , and the last to be sent out were the first to be reawakened .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understandable , commander , since their knowledge framework was closer to that era\\xe2\\x80\\x99s .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cright . eventually your contingent was the only one left in hibernation . the great ravine ended and the world entered a period of rapid development . defeatism had practically vanished , so there was no need to reawaken you . at the time , the fleet made the decision to keep you until the doomsday battle .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommander , this was actually what we all hoped for ,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d zhang beihai said excitedly .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the highest honor of all space servicemen . they were well aware of this when they made that decision . but present circumstances are totally different , as you of course know .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the commander pointed at the river of stars behind him . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe doomsday battle might never even take place .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s excellent , commander . my small regret as a soldier counts for nothing compared with the great victory humanity is about to welcome . i just hope you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to fulfill our one request : to let us join the fleet at the lowest level , as ordinary soldiers , to do whatever work we can .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe commander shook his head . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe length of service for all special contingent personnel will resume from the date of reawakening , and ranks will be elevated one or two levels .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommander , that shouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be . we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t want to spend our remaining years in an office . we want to go to the fleet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s front lines . two centuries ago , the space force was our dream . without it , our lives have no meaning . but even at our present ranks , we are unqualified for work in the fleet .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci never said i wanted you to leave the fleet . precisely the opposite . you will all be working in the fleet to complete a highly important mission .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthank you , commander . but what mission can there be for us today ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe commander did not answer him . instead , as if it had only just occurred to him , he said , \\xe2\\x80\\x9care you okay with talking while standing like this ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the commander\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office had no chairs , and the table had been designed to be high enough to work at while standing . fleet command\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rotation produced one-sixth of earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gravity , which meant there wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t much difference between standing and sitting .\\n\\nzhang beihai smiled and nodded . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot a problem . i spent a year in space .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cand the language ? do you have any communication problems in the fleet ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe commander was speaking standard chinese , but the three fleets had formed a language of their own , similar to the modern chinese and modern english on earth , but with the two languages blended more closely . chinese and english words each accounted for half of the vocabulary .\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cat first\\xe2\\x80\\x94mostly because i couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t distinguish between chinese and english vocabulary\\xe2\\x80\\x94but i was able to understand it pretty quickly . speaking is more difficult .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t matter . if you just use english or chinese when you speak , we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll be able to understand you . so that means that the general staff department has fully briefed you ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right . in the first few days on base , they gave us a comprehensive introduction to everything .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthen you must be aware of the mental seal .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9crecent investigations still haven\\xe2\\x80\\x99t discovered any signs of the imprinted . what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s your read ?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ci believe that one possibility is that the imprinted have disappeared . another possibility is that they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve been deeply hidden . if a person has an ordinary defeatist mentality , they will speak of it to others . but a one-hundred-percent unshakeable technologically hardened faith will inevitably produce a corresponding sense of mission . defeatism and escapism are intimately related , and if the imprinted really exist , then their ultimate mission is bound to be accomplishing an escape into the universe . but to achieve this goal , they have to deeply conceal their true thoughts .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nthe commander nodded with approval . \\xe2\\x80\\x9can excellent analysis . this is the opinion of general staff .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommander , the second alternative is very dangerous .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cyes , it is , particularly with the trisolaran probe so close to the solar system . the fleet is divided by command system classifications into two major groups . the first , a distributed command system , is a traditional structure akin to the naval craft you once commanded . the captain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s orders are carried out by various operating personnel . the second is a centralized command system . the captain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s orders are carried out automatically by the ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s computer . the most recently built advanced space warships , as well as those currently under construction , fall into this category . it is mainly against this category of warship that the mental seal poses a threat , because the captain wields enormous power in the command system . he can unilaterally control when the ship leaves and returns to port , its speed and course , and even a large portion of its weapons systems . under this command system , you could call the ship an extension of the captain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body . right now , 179 of the 695 stellar-class warships in the fleet have a centralized command system . the commanding officers on board these ships will be the focus of review . originally , all the warships involved in the review process were supposed to be docked and sealed up , but present circumstances no longer permit this , because the three fleets are preparing to intercept the trisolaran probe when it arrives . this will be the first actual engagement between the space fleet and the trisolaran invaders , so all warships must be on standby .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n"
